# Transfer-Learning-with-Pre-Trained-Models-in-TensorFlow-and-PyTorch
This repository contains examples of transfer learning using pre-trained models in TensorFlow and PyTorch.


Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to showcase how pre-trained models can be leveraged for transfer learning tasks, where a model trained on a large dataset is fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
